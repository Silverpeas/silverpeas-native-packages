This project aims to deliver Silverpeas within some GNU/Linux distribution
specific packages:
* a DEB package for Debian-based GNU/Linux distribution,
* and a RPM package for each major RPM-based distribution (RedHat, Fedora,
CentOS, and OpenSUSE).

For doing, it provides shell scripts to build theses packages. The build of a
RPM-based package requires to be done on the targeted RPM-based distribution.
For example, the package for Fedora has to be build on a Fedora OS.
The build of a Debian package can be done in any GNU/Linux systems having
the debian packages building utilities.

The main script is build.sh and it accepts as parameters the package to make
(deb or rpm) and the version number of Silverpeas to build.
It first downloads the Silverpeas installer and the JBoss application server
distribution into the files/ directory so that they can be used by any
packaging build.
It then delegates the build to a more specific script: build-deb.sh for making a
DEB package or build-rpm.sh for making a RPM package.

Specific packaging instructions and Silverpeas setup files related to a
GNU/Linux distribution type (Debian or RPM based distribution) are located in
the packaging specific directory: deb/ for DEB packaging and rpm/ for RPM
packaging.
Common resources are located into the files/ directory.
