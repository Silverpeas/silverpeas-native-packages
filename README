This project aims to build Silverpeas into a DEB or a RPM packages for
GNU/Linux systems.

The main script is build.sh and it accepts as parameters the package to make
(deb, rpm or all) and the version number of Silverpeas to build.
It first downloads the Silverpeas installer and the JBoss application server
distribution into the files/ directory so that they can be used by any
packaging build.
It then delegates the build to a more specific script: build-deb.sh for making a
DEB package or build-rpm.sh for making a RPM package.

Specific packaging instructions and Silverpeas setup files related to a
GNU/Linux distribution type (Debian or RPM based distribution) are located in
the packaging specific directory: deb/ for DEB packaging and rpm/ for RPM
packaging.
Common resources are located into the files/ directory.
